    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&lt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as "p" and "/p" surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.

    <h2> History</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Development</b><br><br>
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]

After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]

Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.

    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <p>
        Main article: HTML element
        
        HTML element content categories
        HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: &lt;p&gt;.
        
        In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a &lt;start tag&gt; &lt;p&gt; and "end tag" &lt;/p&gt;. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
        
        Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.
        
        The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the &lt;img&gt; used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: &lt;img src="example.com/example.jpg"&gt;
        
        Some elements, such as the line break &lt;br /&gt;, or &lt;br /&gt; do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.
        
        Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element &lt;p&gt;, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.
        
        The general form of an HTML element is therefore: &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;''content''&lt;/tag&gt;. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the &lt;br /&gt; tag or the inline &lt;img&gt; tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, /, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.&lt;</p>&gt;

        Element examples
        See also: HTML element
        Header of the HTML document: &lt;<head>&gt;...&lt;</head>&gt;. The title is included in the head, for example:
        
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;The Title&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="stylebyjimbowales.css" /&gt; &lt;!-- Imports Stylesheets --&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;<br><br>
        Headings
        HTML headings are defined with the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:<br><br>
        
            &lt;h1&gt;Heading level 1&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Heading level 2&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Heading level 3&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Heading level 4&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;Heading level 5&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;h6&gt;Heading level 6&lt;/h6&gt;
        The effects are:<br><br>
        
       <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
        <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
        <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
        Note that CSS can drastically change the rendering.<br><br>
        
        Paragraphs:<br><br>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
        Line breaks:<br>
        
        &lt;br /&gt;. The difference between &lt;br /&gt; and &lt;p&gt; is that &lt;br /&gt; breaks a line without altering the semantic structure of the page, whereas &lt;p&gt; sections the page into paragraphs. The element &lt;br /&gt; is an empty element in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content and it may not have an end tag.<br><br>
        
            &lt;p&gt;This &lt;br /&gt; is a paragraph &lt;br /&gt; with &lt;br /&gt; line breaks&lt;/p&gt;<br>
        This is a link in HTML. To create a link the &lt;a&gt; tag is used. The href attribute holds the URL address of the link.<br><br>
        
            &lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;A link to Wikipedia!&lt;/a&gt;<br>
        Inputs:<br><br>
        
        There are many possible ways a user can give input/s like:<br>
        
        &lt;input type="text" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is for text input --&gt;<br>
        &lt;input type="file" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is for uploading files --&gt;<br>
        &lt;input type="checkbox" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is for checkboxes --&gt;<br>
        Comments:<br><br>
        
        &lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;<br>
        Comments can help in the understanding of the markup and do not display in the webpage.<br><br>
        
        There are several types of markup elements used in HTML:<br><br>
        
        Structural markup indicates the purpose of text<br>
        For example, &lt;h2&gt;Golf&lt;/h2&gt; establishes "Golf" as a second-level heading. Structural markup does not denote any specific rendering, but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting. Content may be further styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).<br>
        Presentational markup indicates the appearance of the text, regardless of its purpose<br>
        For example, &lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt; indicates that visual output devices should render "boldface" in bold text, but gives a little indication what devices that are unable to do this (such as aural devices that read the text aloud) should do. In the case of both &lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italic text&lt;/i&gt;, there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but that are more semantic in nature, such as &lt;strong&gt;strong text&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;emphasized text&lt;/em&gt; respectively. It is easier to see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter two elements. However, they are not equivalent to their presentational counterparts: it would be undesirable for a screen reader to emphasize the name of a book, for instance, but on a screen, such a name would be italicized. Most presentational markup elements have become deprecated under the HTML 4.0 specification in favor of using CSS for styling.<br>
        Hypertext markup makes parts of a document into links to other documents<br>
        An anchor element creates a hyperlink in the document and its href attribute sets the link's target URL. For example, the HTML markup &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, will render the word "Wikipedia" as a hyperlink. To render an image as a hyperlink, an img element is inserted as content into the a element. Like br, img is an empty element with attributes but no content or closing tag. &lt;a href="https://example.org"&gt;&lt;img src="image.gif" alt="descriptive text" width="50" height="50" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.<br>
