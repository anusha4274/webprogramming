        As we all know HTML is a language of the web. It's used to design the web pages or we can say structure the page layouts of a website.  HTML stands for HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE, as its full form suggests it’s not any programming language, a markup language. So, while the execution of HTML code we can’t face any such error. In real HTML code wasn’t compiled or interpreted because HTML code was rendered by the browser. which is similar to the compilation of a program. Html content is parched through the browser to display the content of HTML. 
        <li><a href="p2.html" target="base">Heading Tag</a></li>

        <li><a href="p3.html" target="base">Text Formatting Tags</a></li>
        Text formatting helps us improve the visual appeal of the text in any document. HTML provides many tags to format the appearance of the text on the web page and make it look attractive to site visitors. In this blog, we will discuss what HTML formatting is.

        HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain −
<pre>
ul − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.

        <li><a href="p5.html" target="base">use of Image in html</a></li>
        HTML img tag is used to display image on the web page. HTML img tag is an empty tag that contains attributes only, closing tags are not used in HTML image element.


        <li><a href="p6.html" target="base">use of image as link</a></li>
        We can make elements like images into links by nesting them within an a element. It defines a hyperlink that is used to link from one page to another. If the a tag has no href attribute, then it will be only a placeholder for a hyperlink.
             <li><a href="p8.html" target="base">table in html</a></li> 
             HTML Table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns, or possibly in a more complex structure. Tables are widely used in communication, research, and data analysis. Tables are useful for various tasks such as presenting text information and numerical data. It can be used to compare two or more items in the tabular form layout. Tables are used to create databases
        <li><a href="p7.html" target="base">Nested table in html</a></li>
        HTML supports this functionality and is known as the nesting of the tables. Tables can be nested together to create a table inside a table.

        To create a nested table, we need to create a table using the <table> tag. This table is known as the outer table. The second table that will be nested table is called the inner table. This table is also created using the <table> tag but there is a special thing that must be kept in mind.
            <li><a href="p9.html" target="base">internal and external links</a></li>
            An internal link is used in html page to navigate properly in the webpage. If you want to go to any specific location in the same page by clicking on a link, you can create an internal link in the webpage. <a> tag is used for link creation in html page.
                An external link is used to interconnect two html webpages. When you want to navigate to some other page or any other URL by clicking on a link on webpage, external links are created. An external link can be created by using anchor tag in html web page.
